'''
Another type in Python is the Boolean type.
There are two Boolean values: True and False.
They can be created by comparing values,
for instance by using the equal operator ==.

Be careful not to confuse assignment (one equals sign)
with comparison (two equals signs).

Comparison

Another comparison operator, the not equal operator (!=), 
evaluates to True if the items being compared aren't equal, 
and False if they are.
