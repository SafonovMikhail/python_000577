Exercise 8
Write the first line of an [if-statement] that tests whether one variable 
is greater than or equal to another variable. Make up the variable names.
Solution:
if var1>=var2:

Exercise 9
Write an if statement that tests whether a variable is smaller than 99. 
If the test passes, assign 99 to the variable. Make up the variable name. 
Remember to indent the second line two spaces.
Solution:
if var1<99:
    var1 = 99

Exercise 10
Write an if statement that tests whether a first variable 
is greater than a second variable. If the test passes, 
make the second variable equal to the first variable. 
Make up the variable names.
Solution:
