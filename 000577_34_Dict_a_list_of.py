# 34 Creating a list of dictionaries
customer_ids = [101, 102, 103]
customers = [
    {
        "customer id": 0,
        "first name":"John",
        "last name": "Ogden",
        "address": "301 Arbor Rd.",
        },
    {
        "customer id": 1,
        "first name":"Ann",
        "last name": "Sattermyer",
        "address": "PO Box 1145",
        },
    {
        "customer id": 2,
        "first name":"Jill",

    ]
# Then come the three elements of the list, enclosed in square brackets.
# As in any dictionary, the three key-value pairs in these dictionaries are enclosed in curly brackets and separated by commas.
# Each customer does have an identifying number, but the number
# is no longer part of a dictionary name.
# Now the customer number is an integer, a value
# like 101, 102, or 103 that's paired with a key, "customer id."
